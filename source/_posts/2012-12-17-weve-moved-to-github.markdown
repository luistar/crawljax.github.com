Crawljax is alive and kicking again! We've started off by moving the Crawljax project to Github. This makes contributing to the project much easier using Git's decentralized approach and Github's pull requests.

All issues from Goole Code have been imported into [Github's issue tracker](https://github.com/crawljax/crawljax/issues), and [the wiki has moved as well](https://github.com/crawljax/crawljax/wiki). With this new website we will keep everyone informed about Crawljax's development.

Feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/crawljax/crawljax/issues) or [fork our repo](https://github.com/crawljax/crawljax/) and generate a pull request!
